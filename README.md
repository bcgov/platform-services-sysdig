# Sysdig Monitor and Secure

### Purpose
Sysdig is the centralized monitoring tool to support both Monitoring Operations teams and Application teams across the BCGov OpenShift platform. This solution will remove the dependency on "in cluster" monitoring tools and will scale well with additional clusters and cloud workloads. 

### Documentation

- [All Maintenance related topics](docs/maintenance.md)

### Operator
A custom Ansible-based operator has been created to manage Users, Teams and Dashboard Templates in the Sysdig Monitor and Secure platform.
